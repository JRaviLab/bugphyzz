Bugphyzz is a collection of physiological features about bacteria. We are curating the databases through 3 main methods: webscraping, bulk download from online databases, and manual curation from literature. Mainly this database will be used to analyze microbiome data.

## Definitions
* **NCBI ID**: National Center for Bioinfomatic numeric ID to link to specific taxa.
* **Genome ID**: From NCBI, another type of numeric ID, that links to a specific sequenced genome. Not all taxa have a NCBI ID, and might only have a Genome ID
* **Accession ID**: The accession number is a unique identifier assigned to a record in sequence databases such as GenBank. Several NCBI databases use the format [alphabetical prefix][series of digits]. A change in the record in some databases (e.g. GenBank) is tracked by an integer extension of the accession number, an Accession.
* **Taxon name**: a human readable organismal name that can delinate which level taxa the annotation is describing.
* **Attribute**: a value for a physiology, that is mapped to an ontology whenever possible. These are defined in the `attribute` column of [inst/extdata/attributes.tsv](https://github.com/waldronlab/bugphyzz/blob/main/inst/extdata/attributes.tsv
 **Physiology**: a microbial characteristic that can be measured or observed, that should be mapped to an ontology wherever possible. These are defined in [inst/extdata/links.tsv](https://github.com/waldronlab/bugphyzz/blob/main/inst/extdata/links.tsv).
* **Attribute value**: a value describing a physiology. Allowable values are defined by the `validity` column of [inst/extdata/attributes.tsv](https://github.com/waldronlab/bugphyzz/blob/main/inst/extdata/attributes.tsv). For categorical attributes (such as "obligately aerobic"), values can be "TRUE" and "FALSE", for example. For numeric attributes, these can be numeric values.
* **Attribute source**: a citeable domain which the annotation was obtained. A source can be another database or primary literature.
* **Frequency**: Describes how often the attritbute (phenotype) occurs: Rarely, Sometimes, Usually, Always, or Unknown. If the source makes the attribute unclear how often it occurs, then an unknown is given.
* **Evidence codes**: As the Gene Ontology defines different forms of evidence a source was obtained the annotation. 

EXP: Experimental data, the attribute was obtained through labortory confirmations, and ideally more than once.

IGC: Computational predicted through means of metagenomic analysis, or more broadly, genome analysis.

ASR: Anstrestal State Reconstruction, was predicted using ASR computional techniques to predicted up and down the taxonmic tree of taxa that has a value.

* **Note**: Any additional information that does not fit in any fixed column. The information here is variable.
* **MIDAS ID**: Located in the Habitat attribute. Any annotation from the MIDAS database is assigned an ID number. We provided that ID here.
* **Parent name**: The parent of descendant given in Taxon name column. Values can indudes names or NA.
* **Species name**: The species name, or descendant of parent, given in the Taxon name column. Values can indudes names or NA.
* **Unit**: defines unit of attribute, like Âµm.
* **Rank**: The taxonomic rank of the annotation. Values can indudes names or NA.
* **Parent Rank**: The taxonmic rank of the parent of the annotation. Values can indudes names or NA.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bugphyzz with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("waldronlab/bugphyzz")
```

## Some examples of how to create signatures

``` r
suppressMessages({
    library(bugphyzz)
    library(purrr)
    aer <- physiologies('aerophilicity')[[1]]
    ph <- physiologies('optimal ph')[[1]]
})

## Example 1
## Create a signature of genera with experimental evidence at a 
## Frequency of always using the NCBI taxids. Minimumn of 10 microbes per
## signature
aer_sig <- makeSignatures(
    aer, tax.id.type = 'NCBI_ID', tax.level = 'genus', 
    Frequency = 'always', Evidence = 'exp', min.size = 10
)
#> Warning: Dropping 3648 rows with FALSE values.
#> Creating signature for categorical attributes.

map_int(aer_sig, length)
#>                 aerobic               anaerobic facultatively anaerobic 
#>                     574                     294                     174

map(aer_sig, ~ head(.x, 2))
#> $aerobic

## Example 2
## Create a signature of acidiphilic species using the Taxon names
acid_sig <- makeSignatures(
    df = ph, tax.id.type = 'Taxon_name', tax.level = 'species',
    max = 4
)
#> Creating signature for continuous attribute.
head(acid_sig[[1]])
#> [1] "Leptospirillum ferriphilum"     "Sulfobacillus acidophilus"     
#> [3] "Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans"  "Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans"
#> [5] "Acidimicrobium ferrooxidans"    "Thermoplasma volcanium"

## Create a signature of Alkaliphilic species using the Taxon names
basic_sig <- makeSignatures(
    df = ph, tax.id.type = 'Taxon_name', tax.level = 'species', 
    min = 8
)
#> Creating signature for continuous attribute.
head(basic_sig[[1]])
#> [1] "Arhodomonas aquaeolei"        "Glaciecola nitratireducens"  
#> [3] "Pseudomonas coronafaciens"    "Sodalis glossinidius"        
#> [5] "Photorhabdus luminescens"     "Hyphomicrobium nitrativorans"
